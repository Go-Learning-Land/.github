# What is Golang?

The [Go](https://go.dev/doc/) programming language is an open-source project to make programmers more productive.
Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Go Learning Land (GLL) is a non-profit organization that helps other people to learn and develop new skills in Golang. We are currently starting a project for ERC-721 Gopher NFTs in Ethereum mainnet. We are trying to build a non-toxic golang community for every skill level; each gopher will own a unique NFT for free.
