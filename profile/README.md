# What is Golang?

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go. [Full Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))

The [Go](https://go.dev/doc/) programming language is an open-source project to make programmers more productive.
Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. [Full Text](https://go.dev/doc/)

# What is Go Learning Land?

Go Learning Land (GLL) is a non-profit organization that helps other people to learn and develop new skills in Golang. We are currently starting a project for ERC-721 Gopher NFTs in Ethereum mainnet. We are trying to build a non-toxic golang community for every skill level; each gopher will own a unique NFT for free. These NFTs will be badges for the GLL cult. Our community will start by collecting learning source material for golang at all levels. Therefore we create [Go Learning Archive](https://github.com/Go-Learning-Land/Go-Learning-Archive). PRs are welcome.

# How to mint GLL NFTs?

1. Wait for minting state. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoLearningLand)
2. Go to [GLL website](https://golearningland.com) and click on mint button shown in image.
3. Use your Metamask wallet for pay gas fees. See more information on [Metamask website](https://metamask.io/)
4. Wait for yout NFT to appear in wallet.
